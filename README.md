# Full-Stack Creative Director ðŸ˜Ž

### Currently doing awesome design things for [tea](https://tea.xyz).

I'm an entrepreurial and creative powerhouse with a passion for learning new skills and creating new things. I've traveled the world as a digital nomad, I've served as a creative leader for numerous start-ups, and I'm currently doing amazing things for a web3 company called tea. I'm currently based in Boston, but I haven't lost the travel bug just yet.
